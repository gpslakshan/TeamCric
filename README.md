This is the Software Development Group Project which we did as part of our SDGP module in the university. In this project, we developed a mobile application 
with a machine learning model which can predict the batting and bowling performance of players by analyzing playersâ€™ characteristics, stats, match format and venue 
using supervised machine learning techniques
